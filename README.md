## Important Points

- To work with Layout we have Flexbox in React native
  -Flexbox contain of 2 main entities

1. Flex container
2. flex items

- Axes in React Native:

1. Main axis--> run from `Top' to #bottom
2. Cross axis--> runs from #Left to #Right

## Flex

- The flex property plays a crucial role in defining how much of view will fill the screen along main axis.
- It accepts an Integer value greater than or equals to 0, indicating the fraction of the available space that the component should occupy.
- The View container in React Native has already display: flex set by defualt-the property that changes div to flex container.
- The flex property is NOT limited to container but its also applicable to flex items (takes fraction of available space).
